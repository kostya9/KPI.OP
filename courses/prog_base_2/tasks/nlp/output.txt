At, the, sunset, hour, of, one, warm, spring, day, two, men, were, to, be, seen, at, Patriarch, s, Ponds, The, first, of, them--aged, about, forty, dressed, in, a, greyish, summer, suit--was, short, dark-haired, well-fed, and, bald, He, carried, his, decorous, pork-pie, hat, by, the, brim, and, his, neatly, shaven, face, was, embellished, by, black, hornrimmed, spectacles, of, preternatural, dimensions, The, other, a, broad-shouldered, young, man, with, curly, reddish, hair, and, a, check, cap, pushed, back, to, the, nape, of, his, neck, was, wearing, a, tartan, shirt, chewed, white, trousers, and, black, sneakers, The, first, was, none, other, than, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, Berlioz, editor, of, a, highbrow, literary, magazine, and, chairman, of, the, management, cofnmittee, of, one, of, the, biggest, Moscow, literary, clubs, known, by, its, abbreviation, as, massolit;, his, young, companion, was, the, poet, Ivan, Nikolayich, Poniryov, who, wrote, under, the, pseudonym, of, Bezdomny, Reaching, the, shade, of, the, budding, lime, trees, the, two, writers, went, straight, to, a, gaily-painted, kiosk, labelled, Beer, and, Minerals, There, was, an, oddness, about, that, terrible, day, in, May, which, is, worth, recording, :, not, only, at, the, kiosk, but, along, the, whole, avenue, parallel, to, Malaya, Bronnaya, Street, there, was, not, a, person, to, be, seen, It, was, the, hour, of, the, day, when, people, feel, too, exhausted, to, breathe, when, Moscow, glows, in, a, dry, haze, as, the, sun, disappears, behind, the, Sadovaya, Boulevard--yet, no, one, had, come, out, for, a, walk, under, the, limes, no, one, was, sitting, on, a, bench, the, avenue, was, empty, A, glass, of, lemonade, please, said, Berlioz, There, isn, t, any, replied, the, woman, in, the, kiosk, For, some, reason, the, request, seemed, to, offend, her, enquired, Bezdomny, in, a, hoarse, voice, Beer, s, being, delivered, later, this, evening, said, the, woman, Well, what, have, you, got, Apricot, juice, only, it, s, warm, was, the, answer, All, right, let, s, have, some, The, apricot, juice, produced, a, rich, yellow, froth, making, the, air, smell, like, a, hairdresser, s, After, drinking, it, the, two, writers, immediately, began, to, hiccup, They, paid, and, sat, down, on, a, bench, facing, the, pond, their, backs, to, Bronnaya, Street, Then, occurred, the, second, oddness, which, affected, Berlioz, alone, He, suddenly, stopped, hiccuping, his, heart, thumped, and, for, a, moment, vanished, then, returned, but, with, a, blunt, needle, sticking, into, it, In, addition, Berlioz, was, seized, by, a, fear, that, was, groundless, but, so, powerful, that, he, had, an, immediate, impulse, to, run, away, from, Patriarch, s, Ponds, without, looking, back, Berlioz, gazed, miserably, about, him, unable, to, say, what, had, frightened, him, He, went, pale, wiped, his, forehead, with, his, handkerchief, and, thought:, What, s, the, matter, with, me, This, has, never, happened, before, I, think, it, s, time, to, chuck, everything, up, and, go, and, take, the, waters, at, Kislovodsk, Just, then, the, sultry, air, coagulated, and, wove, itself, into, the, shape, of, a, man--a, transparent, man, of, the, strangest, appearance, On, his, small, head, was, a, jockey-cap, and, he, wore, a, short, check, bum-freezer, made, of, air, The, man, was, seven, feet, tall, but, narrow, in, the, shoulders, incredibly, thin, and, with, a, face, made, for, derision, Berlioz, s, life, was, so, arranged, that, he, was, not, accustomed, to, seeing, unusual, phenomena, Paling, even, more, he, stared, and, thought, in, consternation, :, It, can, t, be, But, alas, it, was, and, the, tall, transparent, gentleman, was, swaying, from, left, to, right, in, front, of, him, without, touching, the, ground, Berlioz, was, so, overcome, with, horror, that, he, shut, his, eyes, When, he, opened, them, he, saw, that, it, was, all, over, the, mirage, had, dissolved, the, chequered, figure, had, vanished, and, the, blunt, needle, had, simultaneously, removed, itself, from, his, heart, D, you, know, Ivan, the, heat, nearly, gave, me, a, stroke, just, then, I, even, saw, something, like, a, hallucination, He, tried, to, smile, but, his, eyes, were, still, blinking, with, fear, and, his, hands, trembled, However, he, gradually, calmed, down, flapped, his, handkerchief, and, with, a, brave, enough, Well, now, carried, on, the, conversation, that, had, been, interrupted, by, their, drink, of, apricot, juice, They, had, been, talking, it, seemed, about, Jesus, Christ, The, fact, was, that, the, editor, had, commissioned, the, poet, to, write, a, long, anti-religious, poem, for, one, of, the, regular, issues, of, his, magazine, Ivan, Nikolayich, had, written, this, poem, in, record, time, but, unfortunately, the, editor, did, not, care, for, it, at, all, Bezdomny, had, drawn, the, chief, figure, in, his, poem, Jesus, in, very, black, colours, yet, in, the, editor, s, opinion, the, whole, poem, had, to, be, written, again, And, now, he, was, reading, Bezdomny, a, lecture, on, Jesus, in, order, to, stress, the, poet, s, fundamental, error, It, was, hard, to, say, exactly, what, had, made, Bezdomny, write, as, he, had--whether, it, was, his, great, talent, for, graphic, description, or, complete, ignorance, of, the, subject, he, was, writing, on, but, his, Jesus, had, come, out, well, completely, alive, a, Jesus, who, had, really, existed, although, admittedly, a, Jesus, who, had, every, possible, fault, Berlioz, however, wanted, to, prove, to, the, poet, that, the, main, object, was, not, who, Jesus, was, whether, he, was, bad, or, good, but, that, as, a, person, Jesus, had, never, existed, at, all, and, that, all, the, stories, about, him, were, mere, invention, pure, myth, The, editor, was, a, well-read, man, and, able, to, make, skilful, reference, to, the, ancient, historians, such, as, the, famous, Philo, of, Alexandria, and, the, brilliantly, educated, Josephus, Flavius, neither, of, whom, mentioned, a, word, of, Jesus, existence, With, a, display, of, solid, erudition, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, informed, the, poet, that, incidentally, the, passage, in, Chapter, 44, of, the, fifteenth, book, of, Tacitus, Annals, where, he, describes, the, execution, of, Jesus, was, nothing, but, a, later, forgery, The, poet, for, whom, everything, the, editor, was, saying, was, a, novelty, listened, attentively, to, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, fixing, him, with, his, bold, green, eyes, occasionally, hiccuping, and, cursing, the, apricot, juice, under, his, breath, There, is, not, one, oriental, religion, said, Berlioz, in, which, an, immaculate, virgin, does, not, bring, a, god, into, the, world, And, the, Christians, lacking, any, originality, invented, their, Jesus, in, exactly, the, same, way, In, fact, he, never, lived, at, all, That, s, where, the, stress, has, got, to, lie, Berlioz, s, high, tenor, resounded, along, the, empty, avenue, and, as, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, picked, his, way, round, the, sort, of, historical, pitfalls, that, can, only, be, negotiated, safely, by, a, highly, educated, man, the, poet, learned, more, and, more, useful, and, instructive, facts, about, the, Egyptian, god, Osiris, son, of, Earth, and, Heaven, about, the, Phoenician, god, Thammuz, about, Marduk, and, even, about, the, fierce, little-known, god, Vitzli-Putzli, who, had, once, been, held, in, great, veneration, by, the, Aztecs, of, Mexico, At, the, very, moment, when, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, was, telling, the, poet, how, the, Aztecs, used, to, model, figurines, of, Vitzli-Putzli, out, of, dough--, the, first, man, appeared, in, the, avenue, Afterwards, when, it, was, frankly, too, late, various, bodies, collected, their, data, and, issued, descriptions, of, this, man, As, to, his, teeth, he, haid, platinum, crowns, on, his, left, side, and, gold, ones, on, his, tight, He, wore, an, expensive, grey, suit, and, foreign, shoes, of, the, same, colour, as, his, suit, His, grey, beret, was, stuck, jauntily, over, one, ear, and, under, his, arm, he, carried, a, walking-stick, with, a, knob, in, the, shape, of, a, poodle, s, head, He, looked, slightly, over, forty, Right, eye, black, left, ieye, for, some, reason, green, Eyebrows, black, but, one, higher, than, the, other, As, he, passed, the, bench, occupied, by, the, editor, and, the, poet, the, foreigner, gave, them, a, sidelong, glance, stopped, and, suddenly, sat, down, on, the, next, bench, a, couple, of, paces, away, from, the, two, friends, Phew, he, must, be, hot, in, those, gloves, The, stranger, glanced, round, the, tall, houses, that, formed, a, square, round, the, pond, from, which, it, was, obvious, that, he, seeing, this, locality, for, the, first, time, and, that, it, interested, him, His, gaze, halted, on, the, upper, storeys, whose, panes, threw, back, a, blinding, fragmented, reflection, of, the, sun, which, was, setting, on, Mikhail, Alexandrovich, for, ever, ;, he, then, looked, downwards, to, where, the, windows, were, turning, darker, in, the, early, evening, twilight, smiled, patronisingly, at, something, frowned, placed, his, hands, on, the, knob, of, his, cane, and, laid, his, chin, on, his, hands, You, see, Ivan, said, Berlioz, you, have, written, a, marvellously, satirical, description, of, the, birth, of, Jesus, the, son, of, God, but, the, whole, joke, lies, in, the, fact, that, there, had, already, been, a, whole, series, of, sons, of, God, before, Jesus, such, as, the, Phoenician, Adonis, the, Phrygian, Attis, the, Persian, Mithras, Of, course, not, one, of, these, ever, existed, including, Jesus, and, instead, of, the, nativity, or, the, arrival, of, the, Magi, you, should, have, described, the, absurd, rumours, about, their, arrival, But, according, to, your, story, the, nativity, really, took, place,
